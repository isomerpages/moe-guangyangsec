<p>All 4E5N and 4N OOS students will report to the school hall by 2.15pm
on 10 January 2025 in your school uniform for collection of result. You
are to ensure that your grooming is proper e.g. appropriate hairstyle and
turnout.</p>
<p>If you are unable to collect your result personally and wants to appoint
a proxy for collection, please direct your query to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gyss@moe.edu.sg</a>.
Thank you.‚Äù</p>
