<p>The results of the 2024 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education
Normal (Academic)-[N(A)] and Normal (Technical)-[N(T)] Level Examinations
will be released on <strong>Monday, 16 December 2024, 2.00pm.</strong> Arrangements
have been made for your child/ward to receive his/her results in school.
Please ensure he/she <strong>reports to the school hall by 1.45pm.</strong>
</p>
<p>We encourage all students to return to their schools to collect their
results. However, <strong>students who are unwell should seek medical attention and not return to school to collect their results</strong>.
They can appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results from
the school. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents for
the school’s verification when collecting the results. Please contact school
for assistance with the appointment of a proxy.</p>
<p>In addition, we would like your child/ward to take note of the following
when he/she reports to school on that day:</p>
<p>• Come in neat hairstyle and appropriate personal grooming e.g. school
uniform.</p>
<p>• Report immediately to the school hall.</p>
<p>• Clear arrear school fees and/or library loans at the General Office,
if any.</p>
<p>Students who are not in the appropriate school uniform or who do not have
an appropriate hairstyle or grooming will receive their results after their
classmates.</p>
<p>We would also like to appeal for your child/ward to donate their school
uniforms and/or PE attire to the school if they are successfully posted
to another institution so that these donations will benefit future batches
of students in need. He/she can bring the clothing to the General Office
for donation.</p>
