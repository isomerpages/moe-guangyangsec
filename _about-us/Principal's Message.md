<p>Guangyang Secondary School is the third school I have had the privilege
to lead as a School Principal. Each school, each student, and each colleague
has shaped my perspective on the power of education. This journey also
brings me back to the profound influence of my own family, especially my
paternal and maternal grandmothers, who taught me the value of resilience
and sacrifice.</p>
<p>My paternal grandmother was 102 years old when passed away in 2018. Illiterate
throughout her life, she stayed home to raise 11 children, reared pigs
and chickens, and processed coconut sticks to earn extra income. When my
late father applied for Nanyang University in the mid-1960s, he was able
to do so financially only after receiving a bursary from Public Service
Commission and from the money his mother saved from processing the sticks
of coconut leaves. He went on to become the first graduate of the family.
Through his education, he helped his younger siblings through university,
some of whom—along with the next generation—became teachers. This legacy,
from an illiterate mother to a family of educators, is a powerful reminder
of how education can change the course of lives.</p>
<p>My maternal grandmother married shortly after World War II, and my mother
was born soon after. At that time, education was a luxury for girls, especially
for the eldest in the family. However, my mother got her way to be schooled
because her mother (my maternal grandmother) supported her education, allowing
her to receive more schooling than many girls of her generation. My mother
became one of my first teachers, and to this day, she continues her lifelong
learning, reading the newspaper every day. Both grandmothers laid the groundwork
for the opportunities my family and I enjoy today. They remind me that
the power of education is a gift not to be taken for granted.</p>
<p>As I lead Guangyang, I am reminded that our students are tomorrow’s leaders,
parents, and mentors. Every student here has the potential to impact future
generations, just as my grandmothers’ sacrifices echo in my life and work
today. Even the naughtiest students today will go on to become someone's
grandparents one day. Our mission as educators is to help them see that
potential within themselves.</p>
<p>I also recognise that the world is changing rapidly. Unlike past generations,
most of us will not stay in a single career or even field for our entire
lives. This makes lifelong learning, adaptability, and resilience more
essential than ever. One important aspect of this is learning to cope with
challenges, including those we may not enjoy. As someone who took Chinese
Language as first language at lower primary, I struggled with English Language
as a secondary student. My late father, himself a Chinese language teacher,
encouraged me to take English Literature at upper secondary level, believing
that exposure to the subject would help me improve, regardless of my grades.
I accepted the challenge, and eventually, I went on to pursue English language
modules in my undergraduate days. This experience taught me the value of
perseverance in unfamiliar and uncomfortable situations. As Professor Randy
Pausch (author of <em>The Last Lecture</em>) once said, “We cannot change
the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand.”</p>
<p>At Guangyang, we are committed to helping our students build their own
“bank” of experiences—ones they can draw upon in tough times. &nbsp;We
encourage them to learn from both setbacks and successes, to be kind to
others, and to build strong social connections. &nbsp;These foundations
will support them in the many journeys ahead.</p>
<p>I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to be part of our students’ lives,
and I look forward to watching them grow, learn, and contribute to our
community and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
