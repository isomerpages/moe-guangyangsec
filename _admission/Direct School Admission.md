#### Background

The DSA-SEC Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004 to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school.

Under this DSA-SEC Exercise, participating schools will be able to select some Primary Six (P6) students for admission to Secondary One. The selection will be based on their achievements and talents before the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released. In March 2017, MOE approved Guangyang Secondary School as one of the schools under the DSA-SEC Exercise to build on our niche area – basketball.

#### School Vision

Our vision is to nurture our students to be “Learners for Today, Leaders for Tomorrow”. We believe that sports provide a platform for our students to Challenge Convention and Champion their Passion.

#### Achievements

The table below summarises our basketball achievements for the past few years:

Guangyang Secondary School has mapped out a comprehensive 4 Year Programme that is structured to provide students with a holistic learning experience.

Under this programme, students are given opportunities to participate in a variety of activities that allow them to build up their character as well as strengthen their basketball skills. These activities include:
