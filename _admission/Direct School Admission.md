<h4><strong><u>Direct School Admission (DSA) 2024</u></strong></h4>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Background</u></strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The DSA-SEC Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education
in 2004 to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity
to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking
admission to a secondary school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Under this DSA-SEC Exercise, participating schools will be able
to select some Primary Six (P6) students for admission to Secondary One.
The selection will be based on their achievements and talents before the
Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released.</p>
