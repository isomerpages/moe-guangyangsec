<h3><strong><u>Direct School Admission (DSA) 2024</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Background</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The DSA-SEC Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004
to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate
a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to
a secondary school.</p>
<p>Under this DSA-SEC Exercise, participating schools will be able to select
some Primary Six (P6) students for admission to Secondary One. The selection
will be based on their achievements and talents before the Primary School
Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Talent Areas</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our school's vision is to cultivate our students as "Learners for Today,
Leaders for Tomorrow." We firmly believe that our Co-Curricular Activities
(CCAs) serve as a vital platform for our students to "Challenge Convention
and Champion their Passion."</p>
<p>For DSA 2024, Guangyang Secondary School will offer these talents for
Primary 6 students:</p>
