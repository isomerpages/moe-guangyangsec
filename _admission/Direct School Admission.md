1.  **Background**

The DSA-SEC Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004 to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school.

Under this DSA-SEC Exercise, participating schools will be able to select some Primary Six (P6) students for admission to Secondary One. The selection will be based on their achievements and talents before the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released. In March 2017, MOE approved Guangyang Secondary School as one of the schools under the DSA-SEC Exercise to build on our niche area – basketball.

2.  **School Vision**

Our vision is to nurture our students to be “Learners for Today, Leaders for Tomorrow”. We believe that sports provide a platform for our students to Challenge Convention and Champion their Passion.
