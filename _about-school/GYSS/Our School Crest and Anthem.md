<h4>School Crest</h4>
<p>The Guangyang crest symbolises our pupils illuminating the world with
their radiance, like the morning sun rising over the vast ocean.</p>
<p>The strength of the sun brings forth life, radiating integrity, courage
and steadfastness.</p>
<p>Our Guangyang spirit carries us confidently to the future where we will
make an impact on society.</p>
<p>We will touch lives and excel in whatever we do.</p>
<h4>School Song</h4>
<p>In Guangyang we start with a sense of purpose,</p>
<p>We are strong in principles, steadfast in duty.</p>
<p>The light always beckons in our horizon.</p>
<p>Without wavering, we work towards it.</p>
<p>In our hearts, we begin with conviction.</p>
<p>We have faith in knowledge in learning how to learn.</p>
<p>Guangyang will be our light.</p>
<p>The light to excellence forever more.</p>
