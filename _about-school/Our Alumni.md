<p><strong>Objectives of the Guangyang Alumni</strong>
</p>
<p>The Guangyang Alumni aims to foster a strong sense of community among
our graduates, both past and present, while maintaining a connection to
the school. Through various events, we strive to establish and renew friendships,
and create opportunities for collaboration where our students can benefit
from the skills and experiences of our alumni.</p>
<p><strong>Recent Events</strong>

<p>In 2022, alumni members gathered during the Mid-Autumn Festival season,
creating memorable experiences for all attendees. In 2023, they reunited
for the 105th year Homecoming Lunch at the school, reconnecting and rekindling
old friendships.</p>
