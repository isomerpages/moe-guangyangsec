#### NATIONAL EDUCATION MESSAGES

 Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong. We treasure our heritage and take pride in shaping our own unique way of life. We must preserve racial and religious harmony. We value our diversity and are determined to stay a united people. We must uphold meritocracy and incorruptibility. We provide opportunities for all, according to their ability and effort. No one owes Singapore a living. We find our own way to survive and prosper, turning challenge into the opportunity. We must ourselves defend Singapore. We are proud to defend Singapore ourselves, no one else is responsible for our security and well-being. We have confidence in our future.

United, determined and well-prepared, we have what it takes to build a bright future for ourselves and to progress together as one nation.

#### Activities

Guangyang Secondary School aimed to invoke togetherness in being _Stronger Together,_ by infusing the appreciation of Singapore's independence to our annual sports day. This experience was purposeful in allowing students to reflect on how Singapore overcame challenges and continues to do so, closely tied to students' experiences in the various sporting challenges at the individual to the cohort level.
