#### Objectives

The objective is to develop national cohesion, the instinct for survival and confidence in the future

*   by fostering a sense of identity, pride and self-respect as Singaporeans;
*   by knowing the Singapore story -- how Singapore succeeded against the odds to become a nation;
*   by understanding Singapore's unique challenges, constraints and vulnerabilities, which make us different from other countries; and
*   by instilling the core values of our way of life, and the will to prevail, that ensures our continued success and well-being.

#### NATIONAL EDUCATION MESSAGES

 Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong. We treasure our heritage and take pride in shaping our own unique way of life. We must preserve racial and religious harmony. We value our diversity and are determined to stay a united people. We must uphold meritocracy and incorruptibility. We provide opportunities for all, according to their ability and effort. No one owes Singapore a living. We find our own way to survive and prosper, turning challenge into the opportunity. We must ourselves defend Singapore. We are proud to defend Singapore ourselves, no one else is responsible for our security and well-being. We have confidence in our future.

United, determined and well-prepared, we have what it takes to build a bright future for ourselves and to progress together as one nation.

#### Activities

Guangyang Secondary School aimed to invoke togetherness in being _Stronger Together,_ by infusing the appreciation of Singapore's independence to our annual sports day. This experience was purposeful in allowing students to reflect on how Singapore overcame challenges and continues to do so, closely tied to students' experiences in the various sporting challenges at the individual to the cohort level.

**Racial Harmony Day**

One of the key events celebrated in GYSS this year is Racial Harmony Day. Besides encouraging students and staff to dress up in their traditional costume, they were also treated with an array of events such as the Hari Raya Concert and specially planned RHD lesson, which is in line with this year’s RHD theme, Diversity Our Strength. Students also had the opportunity to highlight their talents in the drama and the performing art segments.

These events promote cultural awareness, understanding traditions, festival, belief and values in the Malay community. In addition, this also allows students to reflect the importance of multiculturalism and understand how their strength lies in their diversity.

**Total Defence Day**

Every year on 15 February, our school commemorates Total Defence day with a host of activities. This year was an action-packed one with the inclusion of the Lockdown Emergency Drill and External Holding Area drill. The activities seek to strengthen the belief that everyone has a part to play in the defence of our nation and how values such as responsibility and resilience can be applied in our daily lives.

In addition, in line with the current threats regionally and globally, SGSecure was introduced to students. All Secondary Two students were each given the Guardians of the City strategy card game and through the game, students recognised the complexity of terror threats and how they can help Singapore to be safe and secure.

The assembly programme also touched on the importance of self-reliance and sought to highlight issues such as future threats and challenges and how they could play their part in upholding Total Defence.
