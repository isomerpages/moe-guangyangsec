â€œThrough CyberWellness (CW) education in Citizenship and Character Education (CCE), students learn to be respectful, safe, and responsible users of technology and be a positive peer influence, advocating for the good of the community online.

  
These are the key messages which students will understand: 

**a.** Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities  

**b.** Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence

**c.** Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace 
CW in CCE focuses on the positive physical and psychological well-being of students as they navigate the cyber world. It involves an understanding of the norms of responsible behaviour regarding technology use as well as knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes on how to protect oneself and other users in the cyber world.
