of passionate dancers who represent our school through the art of movement.
Beyond showcasing talent, the team embodies discipline, teamwork, and creativity,

<p>Our CCA nurtures excellence and inclusivity, where every dancer contributes
to impactful performances. Our unique approach views dance as a platform
for character growth, cultural appreciation, and school pride. As a close-knit
team, we inspire one another, celebrate diversity, and spread joy within
and beyond our school community.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)</u></strong>

<p><strong><u>Bi-Annual Concerts&nbsp;</u></strong>

<p>Our bi-annual dance concerts are signature platforms where students take
ownership of the creative process, from choreography to stage presentation.
These concerts develop artistic expression, leadership, and collaboration
skills as students work together to create meaningful performances celebrating
their growth. Through this experience, students demonstrate commitment,
discipline, and creativity while gaining confidence and nurturing lifelong
values of perseverance and teamwork.</p>

<h3><strong>Student Voice</strong></h3>
<p><em>"Through dance, I've learned to be more aware of my movements and how to use my body more effectively - like reaching further and controlling my shoulders when turning. I've also discovered the importance of pacing myself, building flexibility, and persevering towards goals such as achieving a smooth backbend. Dance has taught me discipline, resilience, and how to express myself with confidence."</em>
