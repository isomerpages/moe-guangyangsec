<p>The GYSS Red Cross is a uniformed group dedicated to instilling discipline,
teamwork, and the Red Cross's seven core principles. Through training in
First Aid, Disaster Management, and Youth Leadership, we support students'
holistic development by building confidence, responsibility, and compassion
whilst nurturing a passion for volunteerism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our structured yet diverse approach combines practical skills training,
national programmes, and inter-unit bonding activities. Cadets gain valuable
experience through leadership camps, competitions, modular workshops, and
community service, fostering well-rounded, competent leaders ready to respond
in emergencies and serve their communities with empathy and commitment.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programme</strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>First Aid Championship</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our cadets actively participate in the annual First Aid Championship,
where they demonstrate and refine their first aid knowledge through a series
of realistic, simulated emergency scenarios. This competition provides
an invaluable platform for them to apply practical skills, collaborate
under pressure, and learn from one another. Working cohesively as a team,
they are trained to evacuate casualties efficiently and administer appropriate
medical attention within critical timeframes. Through their dedication,
resilience, and commitment to excellence, our cadets consistently achieve
commendable results, securing at least bronze or silver awards each year.</p>
