<p>The National Cadet Corps at Guangyang Secondary School nurtures cadets
into confident, responsible leaders through military-themed training and
character-building experiences. Our Central District land unit develops
physical and mental capabilities while instilling core values of respect,
resilience, and responsibility through structured activities and meaningful
challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our programme enhances cadets' resourcefulness and loyalty to the country
while building strong camaraderie and leadership skills. Through adventure-based
learning and precision training, we create transformative experiences that
push cadets beyond their comfort zones, developing well-rounded individuals
ready to serve their community and nation with dedication and integrity.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>Precision Drill Squad and Freestyle Exhibition Drill&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>These exhibition drill programmes develop coordination, precision, and
teamwork as cadets choreograph synchronized movements with music. Through
months of dedicated training for competitions, cadets from different levels
work together, building strong friendships and camaraderie. The challenging
journey cultivates perseverance, discipline, and mutual respect while showcasing
their skills and representing the unit with pride and excellence.</p>

<p><strong><u>One-star Kayaking Course</u></strong>
</p>
<p>This annual two-day adventure course equips cadets with kayaking skills
while integrating core values of respect, resilience, and responsibility.
Cadets step out of their comfort zones to overcome water-based challenges
that test their physical and mental capabilities. Through this meaningful
outdoor experience, they gain self-confidence, develop resourcefulness,
and attain new levels of resilience while building stronger bonds with
fellow cadets.</p>
