<p>GYSS Rock Climbing develops resilience and teamwork among students as
they overcome various challenges whilst learning top-rope climbing and
bouldering. As much as their physical strength and climbing techniques
are important, being responsible for their friends as they belay and spot
them is equally crucial. A structured training programme is designed by
a qualified coach to ensure safety and climbing competency during CCA sessions.
Students will be able to put what they have learnt to the test at the annual
Inter-Schools Bouldering Competition and other competitions.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programme</strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>Certification Programme</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our students will go through the Sports Climbing Level 1 Certification
Course where the focus is on safe belaying. With this certification, students
can climb at external gyms and belay others for top-rope climbing. Selected
students who display proficiency in climbing and safe equipment usage will
be able to take the Sports Climbing Level 2 Certification Course that teaches
them to do Lead Climbing. Apart from top-rope climbing, all students will
learn to boulder. They can continue climbing as a hobby at any bouldering
gym, whilst needing only their climbing shoes and chalk bag.</p>
