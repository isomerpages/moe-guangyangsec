<p>Badminton demands excellent fitness: players need aerobic stamina, agility,
strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring
strong motor coordination and the development of refined racket skills.
The game involves intense mental focus, as players must constantly anticipate
and counter their opponent’s moves. Badminton offers a complete workout
for both body and mind.</p>
<p>Our teachers and coach work hard to build the character of each player.
The sport builds 21st century skills, emotional intelligence, and core
values through teamwork, reflection, discipline, communication, resilience,
and ethical play, shaping well-rounded and responsible individuals.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programme</strong></h3>
