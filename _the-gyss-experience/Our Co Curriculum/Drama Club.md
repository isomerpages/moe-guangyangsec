<p>Guangyang Secondary School Drama Club nurtures students to become empathetic
and effective communicators prepared for 21st century challenges. Students
are equipped with performance and backstage theatre skills including acting,
directing, voice projection, and technical production while being exposed
to professional theatre through award-winning productions and drama exchanges
with various schools.&nbsp;</p>

creativity, and collaboration skills, empowering students to deconstruct
and respond to social issues through drama. This comprehensive approach
develops artistic expression alongside essential life competencies, fostering
appreciation and understanding of dramatic arts.</p>
