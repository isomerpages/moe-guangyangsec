<p>Guangyang Secondary School Cross Country Team develops resilient athletes

fortitude. Our comprehensive three-session weekly programme combines speedwork,
tempo runs, and long-distance training across diverse terrains at MacRitchie
Reservoir, Bishan Park, and Bishan Stadium, teaching students essential
pacing and running form techniques.&nbsp;</p>

race, students develop self-awareness and self-management skills while

and relationship management, transforming challenges into opportunities
for personal growth and team bonding.</p>
