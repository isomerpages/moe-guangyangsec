<p>Our Science Department offers student-centric programmes aligned with
the Science Curriculum Framework, preparing students for future challenges
through inquiry-based learning and the RAP approach (Relatedness, Autonomy,
Competence). We empower students to take ownership of their learning whilst
developing critical thinking, inventive thinking, and communication skills,
all essential for the 21st century.</p>
<p>Through hands-on investigations and real-world problem-solving, students
cultivate our school values of Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Care,
and Grit. Our teachers create engaging learning experiences where students
explore scientific concepts through practical activities, building both
their understanding of science and confidence in tackling challenges.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>

workshop deepens conceptual understanding whilst developing critical problem-solving
abilities. Students demonstrate our core values of Respect, Responsibility,
Care, Grit, and Integrity as they collaborate, communicate solutions, and
discover how STEM knowledge creates meaningful impact in their communities.</p>
