<p>Our Mathematics Department is committed to nurturing confident problem-solvers
who appreciate the beauty and relevance of mathematics in everyday life.
Through our comprehensive approach, we develop students' Critical, Analytical,
and Innovative Thinking (CAIT) while strengthening their mathematical reasoning
and computational skills, cultivating the school's core values of Respect,
Responsibility, Integrity, Care, and Grit. Our distinctive teaching methodology
combines rigorous academic training with authentic learning experiences,
ensuring every student discovers their mathematical potential. From talent
development programs to hands-on learning journeys connecting classroom
concepts to real-world contexts, we foster mathematical thinking as a powerful
tool for understanding the world.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>Mathematics Talent Development Programme&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our talent development program nurtures mathematical excellence, inspiring
students to explore deeper applications through challenging activities
and competition training. Students demonstrate Grit and Responsibility
preparing for competitions including Singapore and Asian Schools Mathematics
Olympiad (SASMO), Singapore NIE Mathematics Challenge (NIEMC) and International
Mathematical Modelling Challenge (IMMC). Through systematic problem-solving,
students achieve remarkable success, earning silver medals and distinctions
reflecting their dedication to excellence.</p>

<p><strong><u>Mathematics Learning Journey at Jewel Singapore Changi Airport&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Students apply mathematical concepts in authentic contexts exploring architectural
design, currency exchange calculations, and budgeting principles while
planning meals. Working collaboratively, they strengthen mathematical reasoning
and teamwork skills while demonstrating Care and Respect for diverse perspectives.
This immersive experience connects classroom learning to everyday decision-making,
showing how mathematical thinking supports informed choices in daily life.</p>

<h3><strong>Student Voices</strong></h3>
<p><em>"This learning journey showed me that maths is everywhere. It taught me leadership as I guided my teammates through their roles for each task, helping us accomplish our goals easily. The experience enhanced not only my mathematical understanding but also values like teamwork, leadership, and responsibility." </em>
</p>
<p>Alric Liang</p>
<p><em>"What I appreciate most is how encouraging and approachable my maths teachers are. They don't just deliver lessons but take time to check our progress, answer questions patiently, and motivate us through challenges. I feel comfortable discussing maths problems with them like friends, and these conversations have built my confidence. Their guidance has transformed my mindset from seeing maths as rigid and repetitive to viewing it as creative, logical, and full of opportunities for critical thinking. This supportive environment has made me more interested in maths and willing to embrace challenges in both competitions and class." </em>
