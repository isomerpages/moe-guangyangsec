<p>Guangyang Secondary School's Computing Department empowers students to
become confident digital citizens and innovative problem-solvers through
our comprehensive approach that bridges theory with real-world application.
Guided by MOE's Computer Education Framework, we cultivate computational
thinking alongside critical 21st Century Competencies, enabling students
to tackle complex challenges with logical reasoning and creative solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through our G1 and G3 Computing programmes, students embark on a progressive
learning journey integrating Computer Systems, Data Analysis, Algorithm
Design, and Digital Ethics. Our hands-on methodology ensures students master
technical skills while developing integrity and responsibility, nurturing
adaptive thinkers who apply computational solutions meaningfully to benefit
their communities.</p>
<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<p><strong><u>Collaborative Computing Research Presentations&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Through group presentations, students dive deep into computing theory
while developing essential workplace competencies that mirror professional
environments. Working collaboratively, students conduct independent research
and present findings, demonstrating responsibility in meeting deadlines
and respect for diverse perspectives. This authentic experience builds
confidence in public speaking and critical thinking while creating portfolios
that showcase analytical abilities, preparing them for future academic
and career opportunities.</p>

<p><strong><u>National Computing Competitions &amp; Excellence Programme&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our students extend learning beyond the classroom through national platforms
such as the Annual Game Making Competition, BuildingBloCS conference, and
CENCE's Computational Thinking programs. These challenging experiences
develop advanced programming skills, creative problem-solving abilities,
and confidence to tackle complex computational challenges. Students demonstrate
perseverance and resilience while collaborating with peers across Singapore,
building technical expertise and leadership capabilities.</p>
