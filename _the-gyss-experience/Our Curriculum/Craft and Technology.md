<p>The Craft &amp; Technology Department nurtures creative, confident, and
values-driven learners through authentic learning in Art, Design &amp;
Technology, Nutrition &amp; Food Science, and Music. Guided by Design Thinking
and Inquiry-Based Learning, students develop 21st Century Competencies
such as critical thinking, collaboration, and adaptability while demonstrating
resilience, innovation, and care for others.</p>
<p>Through empathetic design and purposeful creation, students learn to solve
real-world problems with creativity and technological skills. Our approach
develops reflective makers and advocates who use their talents to improve
lives and shape a better world, growing as confident individuals ready
to contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>

<p>We engage students in authentic design challenges where they apply empathy,
creativity, and technological skills to solve real-world problems. Through
3D printing, coding, and rapid prototyping, students cultivate design thinking
and problem-solving competencies. Their perseverance and collaborative
spirit led to the programme receiving the MOE Innergy Gold Award, demonstrating
how innovation, teamwork, and resilience can transform ideas into impactful
outcomes.</p>

<p><strong><u>Creative Expressions Series&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our Creative Expressions Series blends MasterChef Challenge and Art Enrichment
Workshops to develop creativity, discipline, and aesthetic appreciation.
Students design nutritious dishes applying food science while exploring
visual expression through silk-screen printing and ceramics. Both experiences
foster teamwork, perseverance, and self-expression, showing how creativity,
empathy, and care transform learning into purposeful, values-driven outcomes
that nurture cultural awareness.</p>
