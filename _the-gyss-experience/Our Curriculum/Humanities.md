<p>The Humanities Department is driven by dynamic and passionate educators
committed to developing students holistically as critical thinkers and
effective communicators who love Singapore. Our core mission centers on
authentic learning that makes the world our classroom, where students engage
with real-world contexts to deepen their understanding of Geography, History,
Social Studies, and Commerce. Through innovative teaching approaches and
varied assessments, we cultivate students' 21st Century Competencies while
fostering a genuine appreciation for Singapore.</p>
<p>Our approach emphasises experiential learning, where students develop
adaptive thinking, collaboration skills, and information literacy through
hands-on investigations and creative presentations. By connecting academic
concepts to authentic environments and contemporary issues, we nurture
confident learners who can analyse complex situations, communicate effectively,
and contribute meaningfully to Singapore.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h3>
<p>Our students learn through immersive experiences that connect classroom
concepts to Singapore's living landscape. Secondary 1 students conduct
self-directed Geographical Historical Investigations at Labrador Park,
exploring heritage sites while developing adaptive thinking and information
skills. Students also engage in Social Studies Issues Investigation, researching
community challenges to build civic literacy and advocacy capabilities.
Secondary Three Normal Technical students apply Elements of Business Skills
through exploration at VivoCity, analysing retail and F&amp;B operations
firsthand. These authentic learning experiences develop critical thinking,
collaboration, and real-world problem-solving skills, transforming students
into informed citizens and future contributors to Singapore's continued
success.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Creative Assessment for 21st Century Competencies Students demonstrate
their learning through innovative assessments that build collaboration,
critical thinking, and adaptive thinking skills. Working in groups, students
create infographic presentations and deliver speeches that showcase their
understanding in creative and engaging ways. These collaborative assessment
experiences challenge students to synthesise complex information, communicate
effectively, and think adaptively as they present their findings to diverse
audiences. Through these varied assessment approaches, students develop
confidence as communicators while strengthening their ability to work effectively
in teams and think critically about real-world issues.</p>
<h3><strong>Student Voices</strong></h3>
<p><em>"I like finding out more about history and broadening my knowledge on happenings in the past that shaped the world today. Learning history made me understand the consequences of actions, which made me more mindful in real life. History also taught me that harmony is the key to progress and happiness."</em>
