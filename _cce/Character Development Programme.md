<h4>Core Values</h4>
<p>Respect, Responsibility, Care, Grit and Integrity</p>
<h4>Social and Emotional Learning</h4>
<p>Self Awareness, Social Awareness, Self Management, Relationship Management,
and Responsible Decision-Making are the five core social and emotional
competencies. Through Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), students acquire
skills, knowledge, and dispositions that will not only help them to establish
positive relationships but also to recognize and manage emotions, develop
care and concern for others, make responsible decisions and handle challenging
situations effectively.</p>
<h4>Values in Action (VIA)</h4>
<p>VIA programmes are important to character building as they build a spirit
of volunteerism among our students. The school places a strong emphasis
on the inculcation of values through community involvement.</p>
<p>Bishan Home for the Intellectually Disabled and Golden Jasmine are two
of our community partners.</p>
<h4>Elective Module Programme for NA and NT Classes</h4>
<p>Elective Modules (EMs) broaden the learning experiences of our N(A) and
N(T) students and provide for their varied learning styles and needs. EMs
cover a range of industries and give our students the opportunity to pursue
areas of interest beyond the normal secondary school curriculum.</p>
