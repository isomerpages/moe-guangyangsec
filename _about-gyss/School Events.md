They also attended a post performance conversation with the main cast who answered questions from the audience. It was truly an exciting learning experience for these Performing Arts groups!

#### Guardians of the City II card game competition and Ultimate Frisbee competition!

Fancy playing card games with peers from other schools? Our NCC Cadets did just that with Raffles and Beatty cadets! They joined us for a cluster training, and had activities that were split into 3 stations consisting of SAR21 physical relay, Guardians of the City II card game competition and Ultimate Frisbee competition! Throw a guess at who turned out tops? 🫡
