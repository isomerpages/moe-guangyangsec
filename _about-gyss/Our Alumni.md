### Guangyang Alumni&nbsp;

Objectives of the Guangyang Alumni seeks to foster a sense of community among our graduates, past and present, while supporting a sense of connectedness back to the school. Through various events, we hope to establish or renew friendships, while creating potential collaborations that our students can benefit from the alumniâ€™s skills and experience.

In 2022, the alumni members gather during the Mid-Autumn Festival season, and it was a memorable experience for all. In 2023, they once again reunite, reconnect, and rekindle their friendship during the 105th year Homecoming Lunch in school.
