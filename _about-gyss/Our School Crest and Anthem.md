#### School Crest

The Guangyang crest symbolises our pupils illuminating the world with their radiance, like the morning sun rising over the vast ocean.

The strength of the sun brings forth life, radiating integrity, courage and steadfastness.

Our Guangyang spirit carries us confidently to the future where we will make an impact on society.

We will touch lives and excel in whatever we do.

#### School Song

In Guangyang we start with a sense of purpose,

We are strong in principles, steadfast in duty.

The light always beckons in our horizon.

Without wavering, we work towards it.

In our hearts, we begin with conviction.

We have faith in knowledge in learning how to learn.

Guangyang will be our light.

The light to excellence forever more.
