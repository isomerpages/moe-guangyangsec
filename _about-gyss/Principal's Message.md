Guangyang 105: Guangyang Gives Back

Welcome to Guangyang Secondary’s 105th year serving the community.. Guangyang, once known as Kong Yiong High School situated in the Kovan area, was established in 1918 by a group of philanthropic Chinese businessmen who wanted to make a significant contribution to the lives of poor families living in that part of north-east Singapore. Over time, Guangyang has grown to become a recognised name providing quality holistic education to every student that passes through our gates. This 105th year, the school places emphasis on giving back to the community that has so richly and fervently supported it in its mission all these days: to nurture thinkers, leaders and advocates for self, community, and nation. 

There are 2 underlying beliefs that are not immediately apparent behind 2023’s year theme “Guangyang Gives Back” First, that all members of the GY community are ABLE to give back. They each have a unique ability that can be employed in the service of others. Each and every one of our students is uniquely gifted in his/her own way and is able to employ that gift to serve others in the community. With the resumption of all school activities, we are more than committed to enabling every student to discover and grow their talents and strengths. 

Second, that all students have the HEART and are willing to render service to others wholeheartedly and genuinely. We hope that as students go through the routine of community service projects, it is their voice and their personality that will eventually shape the direction of the work and these students will have greater ownership of their contributions back to society. This will put them in good stead when they step out into wider society, having the knowhow and seeing how their ideas and work can positively impact the community around them, our graduates will have the confidence to make even larger contributions to those whom they cross paths with later in life.

It is with this in mind that we step into 2023, recharged by our mission and reminded by our storied past that all students are precious and can achieve and surpass their potential with the right mindset, focused discipline and hard work!
