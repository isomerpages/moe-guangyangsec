### Learning for Life Programme

The focus of Guangyangâ€™s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is in the area of Drama. This programme aims to develop, through Drama, confident communicators prepared for the future. Our LLP targets have two broad outcomes. The first, which we aim to accomplish through our lower secondary literature curriculum, leverages the incorporation of more performance-based lessons into the curriculum and provides an opportunity for all students to perform in front of their classmates at least by the end of Secondary Two. Students are also given an opportunity to experience drama through cohort learning journeys to the theatre. The second target those students who are keener to pursue their passion for Drama, namely those in our recently started Drama Club. To widen their performance horizons and give them a platform to reach a greater audience, we have put together Shine@8Bishan12. This is a series of biennial musicals which also involve the talents of our musicians in the Band and Choir as well as our dancers.
