#### Our Department Vision

A dynamic team who have a passion for engaging in life-long learning and who grow our students.

#### Our Department Mission

To equip students with the right values as well as critical thinking and communication skills so as to enable them to become contributory citizens with global perspective.

#### Key Activities

In line with our school’s aim of developing GYSS students to be leaders, thinkers and advocates as well as our department mission of developing our students to become contributory citizens with global perspective, the Humanities department provides our students with different platforms and an enriching learning experience.  Some examples are the Humanities Learning Week, our Historical and Geographical Investigation projects, Issue-Investigation cum VIA project, Overseas Learning Journey and our Talent Development Programme. We believe that through these activities, our students would gain substantial experience, hone their thinking skills, uncover personal aptitude, develop the right values and confidence and be motivated to excel.

**The ASEAN Symposium** 

The ASEAN Symposium for Secondary School Students 2022 is jointly organised by the ASEAN Studies Centre and Kranji Secondary School, and supported by the Humanities Branch of the Ministry of Education, Singapore. The ASEAN Symposium for Secondary School Students is a dialogue platform for secondary school students in Singapore, policy makers and academic representatives to discuss relevant issues concerning ASEAN. It provides student participants with the opportunity to research and gain insights into the complexities and intricacies of pertinent ASEAN-related issues in the societal, economic, cultural, environmental and political domains, beyond what is covered in the secondary school Humanities curriculum.

**Earth Observatory of Singapore Attachment Programme 2022**

The attachment programme with Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS) for selected Secondary 3 students provided our students the opportunity to understand the work which takes place at EOS. Students on the attachment held discussions with the esteemed EOS scientists to learn more about how climate change and plate tectonics affect Singapore’s changing environmental landscape. Additionally, they learnt about what EOS does in their mission to conduct fundamental research on earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and climate change in and around Southeast Asia, 
towards safer and more sustainable societies.
