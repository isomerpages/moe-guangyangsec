#### Our Department Vision

A dynamic team who have a passion for engaging in life-long learning and who grow our students.

#### Our Department Mission

To equip students with the right values as well as critical thinking and communication skills so as to enable them to become contributory citizens with global perspective.

#### Key Activities

In line with our school’s aim of developing GYSS students to be leaders, thinkers and advocates as well as our department mission of developing our students to become contributory citizens with global perspective, the Humanities department provides our students with different platforms and an enriching learning experience.  Some examples are the Humanities Learning Week, our Historical and Geographical Investigation projects, Issue-Investigation cum VIA project, Overseas Learning Journey and our Talent Development Programme. We believe that through these activities, our students would gain substantial experience, hone their thinking skills, uncover personal aptitude, develop the right values and confidence and be motivated to excel.
