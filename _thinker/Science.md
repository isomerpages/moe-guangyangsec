**ADVANCED ELECTIVE MODULE**

The Advanced Elective Module (AEM) is a collaboration between the school and Singapore Polytechnic. This module is offered to selective secondary 3 Express students who are taking Pure Chemistry and Pure Biology. The module, ‘Application of Science in Forensics’ provides students with an in-depth knowledge of Life Science and serves as an extension of the school’s Life Science programme. The aim of this module is to provide exposure for students to a possible career in Life Sciences by giving them a snapshot of the skills and knowledge required in the field of forensics. The module will also equip students with the practical skills that are relevant to Life Science at a higher institution of learning.
