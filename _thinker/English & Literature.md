*   To provide a strong foundation and rich language for all GYSS students.

### Key Activities

**Tiong Bahru Heritage Estate and Chinatown**

Learning journeys formed a big part of the English Language and Literature curriculum this year with the aim of providing students opportunities to learn outside the boundaries of the classroom.

The upper secondary Literature students took a trip to Tiong Bahru Heritage Estate to investigate the intersection between Tradition and Modernity, Literature and Culture. They were also treated to the play version of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time which tells the story of an outsider who is different and sees the world in a surprising and revealing way. At the annual National Schools Literature Festival, they debated on their set text, The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan, and emerged the winning team.

A learning journey to Chinatown was also organised for Secondary 3 students where they had an interactive experience with images, objects, and people residing there.

**National Library Drama Centre: Peter and the Starcatcher**

For the majority of the Secondary 1 cohort, it was their first step into a theatre when they were treated to Pangdemonium’s Peter and the Starcatcher at the National Library Black Box after the year-end examination.

**Esplanade: Trick or Threat**

What are stereotypes? How are stereotypes applied in our everyday lives? How damaging can it be - especially to our social fabric, in the aftermath of an event that threatens to tear it asunder? The Literature and Drama students were at Esplanade to explore these questions and more when they caught Dramabox’s forum theatre piece titled Trick or Threat. The hour and a half were barely enough as they debated the issues on hand and shared their opinions with the cast members. It bears out the words of the facilitator – forum theatre really is a rehearsal for life.
