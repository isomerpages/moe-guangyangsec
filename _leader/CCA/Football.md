Football CCA focuses on having a strong discipline for our boys. Through strict training routines and close student-coach/teacher interactions, our boys should exhibit the schoolâ€™s 5G values of Grounded and Gracious by remaining humble and respectful to their peers and opponents. All members are exposed to a wide variety of experiences through activities such as overnight camps, friendly matches, football clinics and watching S-league or international matches. We have a development team for those who wish to learn and enjoy the game at their own pace. The school team will have more grueling training sessions to prepare them for competitive matches and tournaments.
