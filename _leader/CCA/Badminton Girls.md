The Badminton Girls Team aims to develop commitment, mental strength, perseverance, fair play, and team spirit in our members. We train twice a week under the guidance of Coach Lee. These training sessions allow the girls to improve on their badminton skills and to build up their stamina and endurance in preparation for competitions such as the South Zone Inter-School Badminton Championship. With support from the school coach and teachers in charge, the girls have made significant improvements and are mentally and physically prepared for the upcoming inter-school competitions.
