The Girls’ Brigade Singapore (GBS) is an international uniformed youth organization for girls, recognized by Ministry of Education of Singapore as a Co-Curricular Activity in schools. We believe in developing our girls to their fullest potential as leaders.

Guangyang Secondary School’s Girls’ Brigade Company is known as the 6th Company and is one of the earliest companies to have been established in Singapore. Embarking on the new Girls’ Brigade syllabus in 2022, the girls will work for badges in compulsory areas such as Brigade Knowledge, First Aid, Drill, and Girls’ Brigade International, and core badges that include Made for More, Made for Good Works, Made for Future, and Made for Adventure.

Made for Adventure (formerly, Physical) – the girls develop physical skills such as basic and creative drill, rock-climbing, going for trails, doing outdoor cooking, and tent-pitching.

Made for Future (formerly, Educational) – the girls have the opportunity to cultivate meaningful pursuits and acquire knowledge and skills such as playing a musical instrument, learning to cook, and design creative work.

Made for More (formerly, Social) – the girls learn to understand themselves in relation to others through discussions and reflections on various issues such as making friends, appreciating their inner beauty, and managing anxiety.

Made for Good Works (formerly, Values in Action) – the girls learn and inculcate sound values that will anchor them in their relationship with others and their responses to issues that confront them.
