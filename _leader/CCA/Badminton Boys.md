Badminton demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed, and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated racket skills. The game also involves intense mental concentration, continually anticipating and pre-empting opponent's moves. Badminton is a sport that provides a complete overall workout for the body and mind.

The teachers, in collaboration with the coach, strive to build up the character of the players. By committing themselves to the rigorous training, the players are able to build up their mental strength and self-discipline, which in turn will improve their attitude towards their academics.

Our badminton team conducts many activities apart from training, such as VIA, NE Learning Journeys, and overnight camps. Although recreational, the team still takes training seriously and aim to participate in zonal competitions every year.
