### **Introduction**

Being in Symphonic Band is more than learning to play an instrument: we learn to work as a team through regular practices, and along the way become more expressive, disciplined and confident. The band is a close-knit family with a shared passion to touch the lives of audience and bring about a greater love of music.

The band program, led by our band conductor Mr Thomas Chen and assisted by Mr Lee Wen Xiang, seeks to infuse character development and inculcate values amidst its vigorous music training. To hone their instrumental playing skills, members are exposed to both the theory and practical aspect of music, suitable for students who have no prior music background. Leadership and communication skills are developed through activities such as band camps and leadership workshops.

The Band Alumni is steadily growing in numbers and many of them are continuing their pursuit in band music. With their continued support and presence in our programmes, they contribute to the Band by motivating and teaching the current band members.
