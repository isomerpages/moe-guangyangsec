### About Us:

#### Brief Introduction

Red Cross integrates character-building, leadership, essential life saving skills and blood donation knowledge, local community service and overseas humanitarian projects in its curriculum, with the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity as a core focus.

It brings out the best of our cadets and to prepare them for leadership in their families and communities. At the community level, Red Cross provides a sustainable platform for our cadets to continue volunteering to serve the vulnerable in their communities. 

Red Cross strives to instil the Red Cross spirit and strengthen core values such as compassion, passion and professionalism in all members.

By participating in providing Singapore Red Cross humanitarian services, Red Cross cadets are groomed to become good citizens with strong senses of civic responsibility. They are trained to be adaptable, resilient and confident team players.

##### Our Key Programme:

Red Cross organises a variety of programmes and activities annually to nurture compassionate leaders for humanity. Cadets develop unique abilities and qualities to inspire and influence positive change in others by their own actions.

##### First Aid Competition (FAC)
The National First Aid Competition is an annual competition which seeks to raise awareness and importance of first aid in cadets.  This platform allows cadets get to show off their first aid skills.

##### Youth Ambassadors’ Blood Programme (YABP)
Established in March 2010, the Youth Ambassador’s Blood Programme (YABP) empowers cadets to champion the life-saving cause of blood donation by providing them with opportunities to advocate blood donation to their friends, family, and community, and the skills to plan, organise and implement blood donation drives and roadshows.
