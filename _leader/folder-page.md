### Vision and Mission

**Vision:** Every Student, A Self-Discipline Student.

**Mission:** To provide a Firm and Caring environment for students to develop holistically.

Guangyang Secondary School adopts a Student-Centric, Values-Driven approach in managing school discipline. By creating a firm and yet caring environment, we aim to nurture a socially confidence and responsible student through Character Development. By instilling the school values, we aim to achieve our students’ outcome of Leader, Thinker & Advocate.

The management of discipline covers three aspects:

i. The developmental aspect of discipline involves instructing, training, engaging, inculcating school values and setting standards of acceptable behaviours.

ii. The preventive measures of discipline focuses on limit setting and the laying down of ground rules and expectations. This is to ensure that pupils are fully aware of the boundaries of what is considered to be acceptable or unacceptable behaviours, and the consequences of breaking the rules.

iii. The corrective segment of discipline involves the use of teaching strategies, self-reflection and intervention procedures to promote acceptable behaviours and change undesirable ones. The aim is to seek cooperation rather than mere compliance in getting misbehaved pupils to bear the consequences of his/her wrong behaviours and work towards preventing further offences.

### Key Activities

**Secondary 1 Orientation Camp \[School value: Respect\]**

Sec 1 Orientation Camp is held during the first week of school to welcome and assimilate our Sec 1s into a new environment and culture. Conducted in-house by our Prefects and Orientation Facilitators, the freshmen underwent a series of activities, including icebreakers and a school tour. To strengthen their class identity, each class designed their own mascot and flag to etch their unique identity.

The programme culminated in a concert where classes showcased their class dance performances, cheers as well as their mascot and flag. At the end of the concert, the Sec 1s were officially inducted into our GYSS family during the Initiation Ceremony.

**Secondary 2 Outdoor Adventure Camp \[School value: Responsibility\]**

The Secondary Two Outdoor Adventure Camp was held in the final week of Semester 1 as part of their post-exam activities. To strengthen their class cohesion, a series of programmes such as Values-In-Action, outdoor cooking and heritage trail are integrated in the camp. This camp also provided an insight into the MOE-Outward-Bound Singapore Challenge which all students will be embarking on as they move on to Secondary Three.

****Secondary 3** \[School values: Integrity and Care**\]

MOE-Outward Bound Singapore Challenge 2022 is a form of Outdoor Education which aims to provide rich learning experiences outside the classroom and helps our students to develop holistically, building up their resilience and ruggedness. The provision of authentic learning experiences aims to help our students to develop 21st century competencies as well as competencies for sustainable, active and healthy living.

**Walk of Dreams 2022 \[School Values: Grit & Care\]**

Walk of Dreams has been a key Student Development Experience for each Graduating Cohort since 2013. With the easing of social management measures, a scaled down version of Walk of Dreams returned in the midst of the pandemic. Students were excited to head out of school, having to interact with their classmates in an outdoor setting and importantly, to be able to capture photos for memories as a class. The walk of dreams allowed students to walk down their memory lanes as a student in Guangyang Secondary School. They penned down their struggles and goals on their mask  - an essential item in the past 2 years. As a cohort, these masks were put together to form the words “GY WALK OF DREAMS 2022”.
