GYSS Parentsâ€™ Support Group (GYSS PSG) strives to promote and strengthen collaboration with the school and community for the GYSS family. We are an active body of parent volunteers who embrace the school vision to provide a caring environment in nurturing the students.

As a parent volunteer, you will get to interact with other parents and share parenting knowledge and skills. Various events for PSG includes fund raising events, Gift from the Heart session for graduating classes, baking workshops and life skills courses. If you are interested to participate and contribute in any way, we warmly welcome you.
