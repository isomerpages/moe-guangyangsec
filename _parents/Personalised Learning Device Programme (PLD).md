<h5><strong>NATIONAL DIGITAL LEARNING PROGRAMME</strong></h5>
<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students strengthen
their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction
of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary
school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed
Personal Learning Device (PLD)</p>
<h5><strong>PERSONAL LEARNING DEVICE</strong></h5>
<p>Guangyang Secondary School embraces the use of technology as a key enable
to achieve the school’s student outcomes. Students will see themselves
use their Personal Learning Device (PLD) purposefully to enhance their
learning interactions, enabling them to learn actively in independent as
well as collaborative settings, both within and outside of their classrooms.</p>
<h5><strong>Guangyang Secondary School Choice of PLD:</strong></h5>
<p>Guangyang Secondary School has selected Next year model Chromebook as
its PLD. Compact yet feature-rich with an 12.2" touchscreen and upgraded
CPU, RAM. Backed by a 3-year warranty and insurance, it's an excellent
value, ensuring years of productive learning.</p>
