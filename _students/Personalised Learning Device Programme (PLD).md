##### **NATIONAL DIGITAL LEARNING PROGRAMME**

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD)


##### **PERSONAL LEARNING DEVICE**

Guangyang Secondary School embraces the use of technology as a key enable to achieve the school’s student outcomes.
Students will see themselves use their Personal Learning Device (PLD) purposefully to enhance their learning interactions, enabling them to learn actively in independent as well as collaborative settings, both within and outside of their classrooms. 

Please refer to the parent’s letter&nbsp;in&nbsp;**Parent’s Gateway**&nbsp;for the details on the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) and the purchase of the PLD for your child/ward. If you are not onboard Parent’s Gateway, your child/ward would have received the hard copy of the letter from his/her form teacher. Please take some time to read through it and respond accordingly.

##### **Guangyang Secondary School Choice of PLD:**

Under MOE National Digital Literacy Programme, Guangyang Secondary School will be purchasing Chromebook Convertible.

Device cost and price includes 3-year insurance &amp; warranty as well as a free stylus.
