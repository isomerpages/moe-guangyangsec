##### **NATIONAL DIGITAL LEARNING PROGRAMME**

At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD)


##### **PERSONAL LEARNING DEVICE**

Guangyang Secondary School embraces the use of technology as a key enable to achieve the school’s student outcomes.
Students will see themselves use their Personal Learning Device (PLD) purposefully to enhance their learning interactions, enabling them to learn actively in independent as well as collaborative settings, both within and outside of their classrooms. 

##### **Guangyang Secondary School Choice of PLD:**

Guangyang Secondary School has selected Chromebook as its PLD. Compact yet feature-rich with an 11.6" touchscreen and upgraded CPU, RAM, and storage. Backed by a 3-year warranty and insurance, it's an excellent value, ensuring years of productive learning.
