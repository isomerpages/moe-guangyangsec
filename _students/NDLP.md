##### **NATIONAL DIGITAL LEARNING PROGRAMME @ GUANGYANG SECONDARY SCHOOL**

Guangyang Secondary School embraces the use of technology as a key enabler to achieve the school’s student outcomes.

In Guangyang Secondary School’s National Digital Learning Programme (NDLP), students will see themselves use their Personal Learning Device (PLD) purposefully to enhance their learning interactions, enabling them to learn actively in independent as well as collaborative settings, both within and outside of their classrooms. Students will also acquire digital literacy in the four components of Ministry of Education (MOE)’s Digital Literacy Framework.

Please refer to the parent’s letter in **Parent’s Gateway** for the details on the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) and the purchase of the PLD for your child/ward. If you are not onboard Parent’s Gateway, your child/ward would have received the hard copy of the letter from his/her form teacher. Please take some time to read through it and respond accordingly.

##### **Guangyang Secondary School Choice of PLD:**

Under MOE National Digital Literacy Programme, Guangyang Secondary School will be purchasing Chromebook Convertible.

Device cost and price includes 3-year insurance & warranty as well as a free stylus.
