<h3><strong>Announcement</strong></h3>
<p>DMA uninstallation and de-enrolment for graduating classes will take place
on the following dates:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>4NA/4T students: 23 October 2025</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4E/5NA: 19 November 2025</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Afer the MOE DMA has been uninstalled, you will be able to use your PLD
without the MOE DMA. Your browsing activity will no longer be monitored
and the browsing history will also be deleted from the DMA system server.</p>
<h3><strong>Before MOE DMA Uninstallation Date</strong></h3>
<p>Your iCON account will be disabled after 31 December 2025. After this
date, you will not be able to access any of your files stored in Microsoft
OneDrive or Google Drive that are linked to your iCON account.</p>
<p>To save your files, please back them up before the deadline. You can learn
how to do this from the following SLS lesson: <a href="https://vle.learning.moe.edu.sg/moe-library/module/view/38b3fc23-6bd9-45df-b431-c5341347c164" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">A1.2g File Management and Data Back-up module in SLS</a>.</p>
<p>When backing up to the cloud storage, you must sign in using your personal
account rather than your student iCON account or MIMS ID. You can also
back up data to personal external storage devices such as portable hard
drives and thumb drives.</p>
<p>Data not backed up will <u>not</u> be retrievable in the event of data loss
during the factory reset.</p>
<h3><strong>Actual Uninstallation &amp; De-enrolment Date</strong></h3>
<p>Ensure that your PLD is switched on and connected to the internet for
the entire day, and refrain from using the PLD during this period. This
is to ensure that the uninstallation process can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Please connect your PLD to a power outler, or make sure it has at least
50% battery charge, to prevent any issues during the factory reset process.</p>
<h3><strong>After the DMA Uninstallation</strong></h3>
<p>You will need to perform a factory reset on his/her PLD if the factory
reset command is not received on the MOE DMA installation date. Please
refer to the attached document for instructions on conducting the factory
reset and verifying that the MOE DMA has been successfully removed from
the PLD. Please note that these checks should be done starting from the
day <u>after</u> the MOE DMA Uninstallation.</p>
